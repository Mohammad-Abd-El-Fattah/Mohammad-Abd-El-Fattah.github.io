At the core of everything I do is a desire to **learn, innovate, and share knowledge**. I believe technology holds the key to solving some of the world’s most pressing challenges, and I’m committed to using my skills to contribute to this ever-evolving field.  

## My Story  

My love for technology began with curiosity—how does the internet work? What makes a program run? These questions led me to explore programming, system design, and eventually, cybersecurity. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to gain hands-on experience through internships with renowned institutions like:  
- **Cisco Networking Academy**: Gaining foundational skills in networking.  
- **Orange Digital Center Egypt**: Working on penetration testing and iOS development.  
- **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative**: Analyzing vulnerabilities to secure systems.  
- **WE Innovate**: Applying cybersecurity knowledge in real-world scenarios.  

These experiences have not only strengthened my technical expertise but also enhanced my **teamwork**, **leadership**, and **problem-solving skills**.  

## What I Do  

My professional focus lies in:  
- **Cybersecurity**: From vulnerability analysis to penetration testing, I work to ensure systems are robust and secure.  
- **Software Development**: I enjoy building applications that solve real-world problems, especially in iOS development.  
- **Tech Research**: Exploring emerging technologies like AI and blockchain to push the boundaries of innovation.  

## Beyond Technology  

While technology is my passion, I’m also a strong advocate for sharing knowledge. Whether it’s mentoring, blogging, or collaborating with peers, I find joy in helping others grow and succeed. I believe that by sharing our experiences, we can create a supportive and inspiring tech community.
