# Cross Site Scripting
## **Basic Knowledge:**

* JavaScript (helpful, but not essential)  
* Client-Server requests and responses

## **XSS Explained:**

* XSS is an injection attack where malicious JavaScript is injected into a web application to be executed by users.  
* Attackers aim to steal data, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.

## **XSS Payloads:**

* Payload: The JavaScript code designed to achieve a specific goal (e.g., stealing cookies).  
* Payload Intention: What the attacker wants the script to do (e.g., show an alert, steal cookies).  
* Payload Modification: Adapting the code to bypass filters and function correctly.
ุณ
## **Payload Examples:**

* Proof of Concept (PoC): Simple alert box to demonstrate XSS vulnerability.  
* Session Stealing: Steals user's session cookie for account takeover.  
* Key Logging: Captures every keystroke typed on the webpage.  
* Business Logic: Modifies user data or performs actions (e.g., changing email address).

## **Types of XSS Vulnerabilities:**

* **Reflected XSS:** User-supplied data is reflected without validation, allowing script injection.  
* **Stored XSS:** Malicious script is stored on the server and executed when other users visit the affected page.  
* **DOM-Based XSS:** Script execution happens directly in the browser without loading new pages.  
* **Blind XSS:** Payload is stored but attacker cannot directly confirm successful execution.

## **Testing for XSS:**

* Identify potential entry points for user-controlled data (URLs, forms, headers).  
* Test these points with crafted payloads to see if script execution is possible.

## **Mitigating XSS:**

* Input Validation: Sanitize and validate user input to prevent script injection.  
* Content Security Policy (CSP): Restricts sources allowed to load scripts on a webpage.  
* HttpOnly Flag: Prevents client-side script access to cookies.

## **Bypassing Mitigation Techniques:**

* Attackers may employ various techniques to bypass filtering and security measures.
