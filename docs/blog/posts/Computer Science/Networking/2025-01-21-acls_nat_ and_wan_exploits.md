# ACLs, NAT, and WAN Exploits
## Module 21: ACL Concepts
### Key Concepts in Detail
#### 1. **ACL Types**:
   - **Standard ACLs**: Filter traffic based on source IP.
   - **Extended ACLs**: Filter traffic based on source/destination IP, ports, and protocols.

#### 2. **ACL Misconfigurations**:
   - Overly permissive rules can allow unauthorized access.
   - Weak ACLs can be bypassed.

### Pentesting Relevance
- Test for weak ACL configurations.
- Example: Use tools like `Nmap` to scan for open ports allowed by ACLs.

## Module 22: ACLs for IPv4 Configuration

### Key Concepts in Detail
#### 1. **ACL Configuration**:
   - Configure ACLs on routers using CLI commands.
   - Weak configurations can leave networks vulnerable.

#### 2. **ACL Best Practices**:
   - Use explicit deny rules and least privilege principles.
   - Misconfigured ACLs can lead to security breaches.

### Pentesting Relevance
- Exploit misconfigured ACLs to gain unauthorized access.
- Example: Use `Scapy` to craft packets that bypass ACLs.

## Module 23: NAT for IPv4

### Key Concepts in Detail
#### 1. **NAT Types**:
   - **Static NAT**: Maps one private IP to one public IP.
   - **Dynamic NAT**: Maps private IPs to a pool of public IPs.
   - **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: Maps multiple private IPs to one public IP using ports.

#### 2. **NAT Misconfigurations**:
   - Misconfigured NAT can expose internal networks.
   - Weak NAT rules can be exploited.

### Pentesting Relevance
- Test for NAT misconfigurations and exposed internal networks.
- Example: Use tools like `Nmap` to scan for open ports behind NAT.

## Module 24: WAN Concepts

### Key Concepts in Detail
#### 1. **WAN Technologies**:
   - **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**: Efficiently routes traffic across WANs.
   - **Frame Relay**: Legacy WAN technology (less common today).

#### 2. **WAN Vulnerabilities**:
   - Misconfigured WAN links can lead to traffic interception.
   - Weak WAN security can be exploited.

### Pentesting Relevance
- Exploit WAN misconfigurations to intercept or redirect traffic.
- Example: Use tools like `Wireshark` to capture WAN traffic.

## Module 25: VPN and IPsec Concepts

### Key Concepts in Detail
#### 1. **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**:
   - Securely connect remote users to a network.
   - Vulnerable to weak encryption or misconfigurations.

#### 2. **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**:
   - Provides secure communication over IP networks.
   - Weak IPsec configurations can be exploited.

### Pentesting Relevance
- Test for weak VPN and IPsec configurations.
- Example: Use tools like `ike-scan` to test VPN vulnerabilities.

## Summary
- **ACLs**: Test for weak ACL configurations and bypass them.
- **NAT**: Exploit NAT misconfigurations to expose internal networks.
- **WAN**: Exploit WAN misconfigurations to intercept traffic.
- **VPN/IPsec**: Test for weak VPN and IPsec configurations.
