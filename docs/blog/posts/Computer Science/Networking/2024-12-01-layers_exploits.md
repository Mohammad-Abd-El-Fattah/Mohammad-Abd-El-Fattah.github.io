# Layers Exploits 
## Module 6: Data Link Layer
### Key Concepts in Detail
#### 1. **MAC Addresses**:
   - Unique identifiers assigned to network interfaces.
   - Used for communication within the same network segment.

#### 2. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**:
   - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.
   - Vulnerable to **ARP spoofing** and **ARP poisoning**.

#### 3. **Switching**:
   - Switches forward frames based on MAC addresses.
   - **MAC flooding** can overwhelm a switch's MAC address table, causing it to behave like a hub.

#### 4. **Ethernet Frames**:
   - The basic unit of data transmission in the Data Link Layer.
   - Contains source and destination MAC addresses, payload, and error-checking data.

### Pentesting Relevance
- Exploit **ARP spoofing** to intercept traffic between devices.
- Perform **MAC flooding** to disrupt network communication.
- Example: Use tools like `Ettercap` or `Wireshark` to manipulate ARP tables.

## Module 7: Ethernet Switching

### Key Concepts in Detail
#### 1. **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**:
   - Segments a network into smaller, isolated broadcast domains.
   - **VLAN hopping** can allow attackers to bypass VLAN segmentation.

#### 2. **Trunking**:
   - Carries traffic for multiple VLANs over a single link.
   - Misconfigured trunk ports can lead to unauthorized VLAN access.

#### 3. **Switch Security**:
   - Features like **port security** and **DHCP snooping** can prevent attacks.
   - Weak configurations can leave switches vulnerable.

### Pentesting Relevance
- Exploit **VLAN hopping** to gain access to restricted VLANs.
- Test for misconfigured trunk ports or weak switch security.
- Example: Use tools like `Yersinia` to exploit VLAN vulnerabilities.

## Module 8: Network Layer

### Key Concepts in Detail
#### 1. **IP Addressing**:
   - IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
   - IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers (e.g., `2001:0db8::1`).

#### 2. **Routing**:
   - Routers forward packets between networks based on IP addresses.
   - Vulnerable to **IP spoofing** and **routing table manipulation**.

#### 3. **Subnetting**:
   - Divides a network into smaller subnets for efficient IP allocation.
   - Helps attackers map networks and identify targets.

### Pentesting Relevance
- Perform **IP spoofing** to impersonate trusted devices.
- Exploit weak routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP) to manipulate traffic.
- Example: Use tools like `Scapy` to craft spoofed IP packets.

## Module 9: Address Resolution

### Key Concepts in Detail
#### 1. **ARP Cache**:
   - Stores IP-to-MAC address mappings.
   - Vulnerable to **ARP cache poisoning**.

#### 2. **Gratuitous ARP**:
   - A device broadcasts its IP-to-MAC mapping without being asked.
   - Can be used maliciously to overwrite ARP cache entries.

### Pentesting Relevance
- Exploit **ARP cache poisoning** to redirect traffic to an attacker's machine.
- Example: Use tools like `Ettercap` to perform ARP attacks.

## Module 10: Basic Router Configuration

### Key Concepts in Detail
#### 1. **Router CLI**:
   - Commands for configuring routers (e.g., `interface`, `ip address`).
   - Weak configurations can leave routers vulnerable.

#### 2. **Static Routing**:
   - Manually configured routes for specific networks.
   - Misconfigured static routes can lead to traffic redirection.

#### 3. **Default Routes**:
   - A catch-all route for traffic with no specific destination.
   - Exploitable if misconfigured.

### Pentesting Relevance
- Test for weak router configurations (e.g., default credentials, open ports).
- Exploit misconfigured static or default routes to redirect traffic.
- Example: Use `Nmap` to scan for open ports on routers.
